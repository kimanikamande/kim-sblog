    <p>it is said that ideas come to life when you do activities like travveling, </p>
    <p>i recently found out my childhood cartoon called tinga tinga tales was made by a british lady who was travelling
        across east africa and an idea came to her that whatever tales she was learning during the travvel could actualy
        be animated and taught to kids in a fun way      </p>
